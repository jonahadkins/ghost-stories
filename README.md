Storytelling With Maps Contest Entry

Created by Kelly Bigley ([@kellybigley](http://twitter.com/kellybigley)) and Jonah Adkins ([@jonahadkins](http://twitter.com/jonahadkins)) , this [2015 Storytelling with Maps contest](http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/story-maps/contest) entry combines fun design and elements from multiple story map templates. The [Story Map Journal℠](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-journal/) template is used to create the map-based narrative for the haunted sites. The spyglass element from the [Story Map Spyglass℠](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/swipe-spyglass/) is used to allow the user to hunt for ghostly visitors to downtown Savannah.
